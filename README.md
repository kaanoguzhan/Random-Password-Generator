Random Password Generator written in Python

Options:                        <br />
-> Default strenght: 20 chars   <br />
-> Use Uppercase                <br />
-> Use Numbers                  <br />
-> Use Symbols                  <br />
-> Use Unicode ( Use this at your own risk, since probably the password field will not accept Unicode and also it can be very tricky to enter without copy-paste)
